Inspired by VAIO's logo. Use underscore for VA ligature (or enable discretionary ligatures feature). Supports cyrillic.
Free for all use, but you can support me either by donating any amount you like or by purchasing one of my commercial fonts from http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Architaraz/.
Enjoy!
