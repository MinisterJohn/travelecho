  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: vaio_con_dios
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/vaio_con_dios/_IO CON DIOS.otf
    - family: segoe_ui
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/segoe-ui-this/segoeuithibd.ttf
          weight: 700 # Use numeric weights for bold
        - asset: assets/fonts/segoe-ui-this/segoeuithis.ttf
          weight: 400 # Normal font weight
        - asset: assets/fonts/segoe-ui-this/segoeuithisi.ttf
          style: italic
          weight: 400
